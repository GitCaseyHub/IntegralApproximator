<h1>Integral Approximator</h1>
<head>This program approximates an integral with n-rectangles using multiple different integration approximation techniques.<br><br>
So far, lefthand rule, righthand rule, midpoint rule, and trapezoid rule have been implemented. To use this program, open a Jupyter notebook, paste the code into a cell, then compile that cell. Upon it compiling, type: figurePlot() into another cell, and you're off to the races.</head>
