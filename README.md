<h1>Integral Approximator</h1>
<head>This program approximates an integral with n-rectangles using multiple different integration approximation techniques.<br><br>
So far, lefthand rule, righthand rule, midpoint rule, and trapezoid rule have been implemented. I think I could add<br>
Simpson's rule, but the visual representation of it is something I'm unsure how to do.</head>
